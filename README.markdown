Twi
=====================================

Twi is a super-micro blogging platform.

The modern person has become accustomed to TV shows that don't waste precious time or attention on trivial fluff, such as character or plot development. He listens to pop music, which focuses on a catchy chorus and cuts out distractions such as chord progressions and verses. And he certainly doesn't have the time or attention span to read 140 characters; brevity is a virtue.

That's why Twi has been designed to focus on keeping things simple and concise. Each Twi message is limited to 14 characters. That's an order of magnitude better than Twitter!
